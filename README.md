# Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself: Creating Monet-style paintings with CycleGAN

## Abstract
In this study, we explore the capabilities of Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) architecture to create Monet-style paintings based on a dataset (Amy Jang et al., 2020) comprising 300 Monet paintings and 7000 realistic photos. GANs have gained substantial attention for their ability to generate synthetic data that resembles real-world examples. In this research, we leverage the power of CycleGAN to investigate whether it can effectively capture the essence of Monet's artistic style and apply it to ordinary photographs.
